        <p> Most accounts of the creation of the lamington agree that it was named
after Lord Lamington, who served as Governor of Queensland from 1896
to 1901, although it might have been named for his wife, Lady
Lamington. One account claims the dessert resembled the homburg hats
that he favoured.Another claim has them named after
the village of Lamington, South Lanarkshire in Scotland. As the
title Baron Lamington itself derives from the village, however, the
question of this connection is merely whether it is direct or
            indirect. </p>
        
        <p> Even among those who attribute the name to Lord Lamington, there are
different claims as to the exact location and creator of the cake
itself. According to one claim, Lamingtons were first served in
Toowoomba when Lord Lamington took his entourage to Harlaxton House to
            escape the steamy heat of Brisbane. </p>
        
        <p> In another claim, Lamington's chef at Queensland's Government House,
French-born Armand Galland, was called upon at short notice to provide
something to feed unexpected guests during the busy period leading up
to Federation in 1901. According to the Melbourne newspaper The Age,
Galland cut up some left-over French vanilla sponge cake baked the day
before, dipped the slices in chocolate and set them in
coconut. Coconut was not widely used in European cooking at that time,
but was known to Galland whose wife was from Tahiti where coconut was
a common ingredient. Lady Lamington's guests then asked for the
            recipe. </p>
        
        <p> A further alternative claim is that Lord Lamington's cook, presumably
Galland, accidentally dropped a block of sponge cake into a dish of
chocolate. It was later discovered that desiccated coconut, sprinkled
            over the top, made the cakes more appealing. </p>
        
        <p> Most of these claims are based on relatively recent reports. For some
time the earliest identified mention of the lamington recipe was
published in January 1902, but the identity of the contributor of that
recipe was not revealed. A 1900 recipe for a cream-filled lamington
has been found, however, in a Brisbane paper - Queensland Country Life
(17 December 1900, p.29, but again with no author
identified). Thereafter, the earliest reference to the naming of cake
located so far is in October 1933, where it is attributed to Lord
            Lamington himself. </p>
