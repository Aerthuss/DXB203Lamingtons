            <h3> Notes before cooking: </h3>
            <ul>
                <li> - You need to cook the cake the day before to make sure that it has
                    enough time to cool down and dry out a bit. </li>
                <li> - If your eggs are very large, you might need to increase the amounts of
                    the other ingredients to compensate. </li>
                <li> - Fun tip: Add some food colouring (a few drops) to your sponge for a colourful
                    surprise. </li>
            </ul>

                <h3> Method </h3>
                    <p><b>Step 1:</b> Preheat your oven to 180C. Grease a 20cm x 30cm shallow cake pan. </p>
                    <p><b>Step 2:</b> Cream together the sugar and butter in a mixing bowl. They
        should achieve a creamy texture with quite a thick consistency. The
        longer, harder and faster the butter and sugar are creamed the lighter
                        the cake will be when cooked. </p>
                    <p><b>Step 3:</b> Add the vanilla essence and the eggs 1 at a time, mixing well
                        after you add each egg. </p>
                    <p><b>Step 4:</b> Add the flour and mix in well. Beat with a wooden spoon trying
                        to incorporate as much air as possible. </p>
                    <p><b>Step 5:</b> Spoon the mixture into the prepared pan and smooth out the
                        top so it is level. </p>
                    <p><b>Step 6:</b> Bake for approximately 30 minutes or until a skewer stuck in
    the centre comes out clean. Turn off the oven but leave the cake
                        inside to cool down slowly for 10 minutes. </p>
                    <p><b>Step 7:</b> Remove the cake from the oven and turn out on to a wire rack
                        to cool. Cover with a tea-towel and leave overnight. </p>

                    <p><b>Step 1:</b> Sift the icing sugar and cocoa into a bowl. Add butter and
                        boiling water. Stir until smooth. </p>
                    <p><b>Step 2:</b> Cut cake into approximately 5cm squares. Place coconut in a
dish. Dip the sides of the cake in the icing mixture. Shake off any
                        excess icing then roll in the coconut. </p>
                    <p><b>Step 3:</b> Place on a wire rack to set (approximately 2 hours) before
                        serving. </p>
